I immediately started to create a Java program to solve the task. I sometimes used the internet for help if I had no clue how to write the proper syntax, make your life easier by using already existing functions of the library, etc. Meanwhile I was also considering how to write the code so that it would spit out the illustrated result after all. Fortunately, I still had old self-written codes of my time at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences that was helpful to use. But there was one issue in my program I did not know why it was not working. So I asked a friend to help me out who instantly saw the issue in my programm and I could fix it. After finishing the task of the challenge I started to write the "Explanation sheet" and the "readme file" to conclude my work.
